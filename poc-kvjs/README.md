# 🚀 KVS JS POC

This project is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for working with **Key-Value Stores (KVS) in JavaScript**. It explores efficient data storage and retrieval using key-value pairs, demonstrating a practical approach for in-memory storage or integration with external key-value databases.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Key-Value Storage (KVS)**
- **Node.js (for running locally)**

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/kvjs
│── index.js        # Main entry file
│── package.json    # Project dependencies and scripts
│── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed, then follow these steps:

### 🔹 Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 🔹 Run the KVS Example

```sh
node index.js
```

## 🛠 Features

✅ **Key-Value Storage Implementation** - Store and retrieve data efficiently.  
✅ **Simple API for Data Handling** - Demonstrates how to interact with KVS.  
✅ **Fast and Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies, focusing on performance.

## 🔍 Testing and Debugging

1️⃣ **Run the project using Node.js.**  
2️⃣ **Check console output for key-value operations.**  
3️⃣ **Modify `index.js` to experiment with different storage methods.**

## 📌 Next Steps

- Expand KVS capabilities with persistence (e.g., writing to a file or database).
- Integrate with a real KVS system (e.g., Redis, Firebase, or localStorage in browsers).
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
