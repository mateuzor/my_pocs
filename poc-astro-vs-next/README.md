# POC Comparison: Astro vs Next.js

---

# üöÄ Overview

This README documents a POC (Proof of Concept) comparing **Astro** and **Next.js** focusing on:

- Page load
- Client-side JavaScript usage
- Performance on slow networks
- Development flexibility
- Framework interoperability (React, Vue, Svelte inside Astro)

Based on practical experiences and the provided reference.

---

# üîç Testing Standard

To compare both frameworks:

- Create two simple applications (one page each)
- No client-side interaction needed (static content only)
- Measure:
  - Bundle size sent to the browser
  - Time to first interaction (TTI)
  - Total number of requests
  - Load time under slow network conditions (throttling)

**Important:** Always test in an **incognito window** to avoid interference from extensions injecting additional JavaScript.

**Important:** Always run a **production build** before testing performance!

**Why?**

- Running in development mode (`npm run dev`) includes debug tools, extra scripts, and unoptimized bundles.
- Production mode (`npm run build` + `npm run preview` or `npm start`) removes development overhead, minifies assets, optimizes performance, and simulates real user experience.
- Only production builds represent the true performance profile of the application.

# üí™ Quick Setup

## Create Astro project

npm create astro@latest astro-poc
cd astro-poc
npm install
npm run dev
```

# üìä Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion                | Astro                                             | Next.js                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Client-side JS usage** | Zero JS by default                                | Always injects JS       |
| **Load time**            | Very fast                                         | Depends on bundle size  |
| **JS control**           | Loads JS only if needed                           | Always loads JS         |
| **Flexibility**          | Supports multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) | Only React              |
| **Simplicity**           | Minimalist configuration                          | Moderate complexity     |
| **SEO Ready**            | Very good (pure HTML)                             | Good                    |
| **Architecture**         | Island Architecture (hydrate on demand)           | App Router/Pages Router |

---

# üèùÔ∏è Understanding Island Architecture

**Island Architecture** is the design principle used by Astro that changes how modern websites handle interactivity and performance:

- Pages are rendered as static HTML by default.
- Small parts of the page ("islands") can be made interactive **only when necessary**.
- Each island is hydrated independently without impacting the whole page.

**Key Benefits:**

- Dramatically less JavaScript sent to the browser.
- Faster first paint and interaction.
- Improved Core Web Vitals (especially LCP, FCP, and CLS).

**Example:**

- A blog post with a "like button" can be rendered as static HTML, while the "like button" is a small interactive island hydrated separately.

This leads to a highly optimized user experience where **static content is prioritized**, and **dynamic functionality is injected only where needed**.

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è Framework Interoperability in Astro

Astro allows seamless integration of multiple frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, **SolidJS**, and more in the same project.

## Example - Using React inside Astro:

Install React integration:

```bash
npm install @astrojs/react react react-dom
```

Add to `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import react from "@astrojs/react";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [react()],
});
```

Create a React component:

```tsx
// src/components/Counter.tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

Use it inside an Astro page:

```astro
---
import Counter from '../components/Counter.tsx';
---

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from Astro with React!</h1>
    <Counter client:load />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Example - Using Vue inside Astro:

Install Vue integration:

```bash
npm install @astrojs/vue vue
```

Add to `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import vue from "@astrojs/vue";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [vue()],
});
```

Create a Vue component and use it similarly.

**Astro makes it possible to mix and match frameworks seamlessly without sacrificing performance.**

# üîç How to Check Performance

1. Run the applications in production mode:

### Astro

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Next.js

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

2. Access the pages in a browser (preferably **incognito mode**).

3. Open Chrome DevTools:

- Go to the **Network** tab
- Enable **Throttling** with "Slow 3G"
- Observe:
  - Bundle size
  - Time to first page load (TTFB/TTI)
  - Number of loaded files

4. Use **Lighthouse** to audit performance:

- Overall performance score
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

# üîÑ Final Insights

- Astro delivers pure HTML content by default, drastically improving load times.
- Astro allows using multiple frameworks within the same project, offering flexibility never seen before.
- Next.js is excellent for complex and dynamic React applications.
- Choosing between Astro and Next.js heavily depends on the project type:
  - **Content first** = Astro
  - **Rich interactivity + React** = Next.js
