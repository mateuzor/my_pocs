# üß™ Vue 3 POC Project

This is a beginner-friendly Proof of Concept using Vue 3 with Vue CLI, showing the most important Vue features in a modular and component-based structure.

## üöÄ What is Vue.js?

Vue.js is a **progressive JavaScript framework** for building user interfaces. It can be incrementally adopted ‚Äî meaning you can use it to enhance a small part of a page, or build a full-scale single-page application.

Vue 3 introduced a more powerful **Composition API**, offering better logic reuse and TypeScript support, while keeping the simple and elegant template syntax Vue is known for.

---

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Vue 3** (Composition API + `<script setup>`)
- **Vue CLI** for project scaffolding and dev server
- **Scoped styles**

---

## üì¶ Features in this POC

- `ref()` and reactivity system
- `v-model` for two-way binding
- `@click` and other event bindings (`v-on:` shorthand)
- `v-if`, `v-else`, `v-show` for conditional rendering
- `v-for` for list rendering
- `watch()` to react to state changes
- Props and emits for parent-child communication
- Lifecycle hooks like `onMounted()`
- API call with fetch and reactive loading/error state

---

## ‚úÖ How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

---

## üß† Real-World Use Cases

- Admin dashboards
- Blog/content platforms
- Reusable form components
- SPAs (Single-Page Applications)
- Mobile apps (with frameworks like Quasar or Vue Native)

| Feature           | Vue                       | React     | Angular        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Learning Curve    | Easy                      | Medium    | Steep          |
| Type System       | JS/TS                     | JS/TS     | TypeScript     |
| Design Philosophy | Options + Composition API | Hooks     | Full framework |
| Size (core)       | Small                     | Small     | Large          |
| Ecosystem         | Growing                   | Mature    | Complete       |

## ‚úÖ Pros of Vue

- Easy to learn and start with
- Clean and readable template syntax
- Powerful Composition API for logic reuse
- Great tooling (Vue Devtools, Vue CLI, Vite)
- Thriving ecosystem (Pinia, Vue Router, etc.)

---

## ‚ùå Cons of Vue

- Smaller job market than React (especially in the US)
- Too flexible in larger teams without conventions
- Slightly less adoption in very large enterprise systems

## üìå Summary

Vue 3 is an excellent tool for building maintainable, scalable, and fast front-end applications with minimal boilerplate. This POC demonstrates the foundational building blocks you'll use in real-world projects.
