# poc-react-async-hook

A custom React hook for managing asynchronous operations with loading, success, and error states.

---

## 📦 What Is This?

This is a complete POC project that demonstrates a reusable custom hook called `useAsync` for handling async logic in React apps, using TypeScript and Vite.

---

## ✅ Features

- Manages states: `idle`, `pending`, `success`, `error`
- Built with TypeScript for safety
- Reusable in any React application
- Example component included

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the example app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

- Observe how `status`, `data`, and `error` change
- Check how `execute()` controls the async operation
- See how you can reuse this hook in multiple components

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

- Fetching API data
- Submitting forms
- Async validations
- Managing loading states in UI
