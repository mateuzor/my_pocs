# üëÄ Intersection Observer Lazy Load POC

A simple and efficient Proof of Concept showcasing how to use the **Intersection Observer API** to lazily load Pok√©mon images from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

Built with **Vite**, **React**, and **Axios**, this project demonstrates how to detect when elements enter the viewport and defer loading of heavy assets (like images) until they're actually visible.

## üöÄ Features

- üê¢ Lazy loads Pok√©mon images only when they enter the viewport
- üì° Fetches a large list of Pok√©mon from Pok√©API
- üîç Uses native Intersection Observer API
- ‚öõÔ∏è Built with React and functional hooks
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast dev environment powered by Vite

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Start development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> App runs on: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### `Observer.js`

Creates a shared instance of the Intersection Observer and defines what to do when observed elements enter the viewport:

- If the image is intersecting, the actual image URL is set from `data-src`
- The image is then unobserved to prevent further unnecessary observation

### `LazyComponent.jsx`

A lightweight component that attaches the Intersection Observer to an `<img>` element using a `ref` and `useEffect`.

### `App.jsx`

Fetches a list of Pok√©mon using Axios and maps over them to render headings and lazy-loaded images using `LazyComponent`.

### Example

## üì¶ API Used

- [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/): Retrieves Pok√©mon names and sprite image IDs

---

## üß† Motivation

This POC was created to:

- Learn how to implement Intersection Observer in a real React app
- Optimize performance by deferring image loads
- Understand how native browser APIs work with React hooks
